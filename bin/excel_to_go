    A note on GOPATH: The generated go file has a dependency, excel.go, which has no further
    dependencies outside of the core Go packages. This dependency is copied into the same destination
    as the generated go file. The tricky bit is how the generated go file can import excel.go
    given that Go does not like relative references in import statements.
     You can either:
     1. Manually specify the import statement to use with the --import-excel-go [PATH] switch
    2. Let excel_to_go guess the right path. It will do this by:
       a. If [output_directory] is under GOPATH, calculating the path relative to GOPATH.
       b. If [output_directory] has src/ somewhere in its path, calculating the path relative to that
       c. Falling back to 'excel.go' which you will then have to manually fix.
