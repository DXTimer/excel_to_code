# TODO

* Sort out parsing of unions
* Optimize IF, CHOOSE, MATCH, VLOOKUP and similar functions so that they don't have to calculate all their arguments
* Fix it so that cells that are being reported as empty, that excel would give a numeric value of zero, are fixed
* Add missing functions
* Add output in other programming languages
