## Parsing bugs

See doc/How_to_fix_parsing_bugs.md for help

* Whitespace handling in table references
* Whitespace handling between arguments in a list
* Doesn't do range unions (e.g., 10:10 C:C == C:10)
* Doesn't do manually entered arrays {1,2,3;4,5,6}

## Missing functions

See doc/Which_functions_are_implemented.md

See doc/How_to_add_a_missing_function.md

## Simplification & optimisation bugs

* Optimize IF, CHOOSE, MATCH, VLOOKUP and similar functions so that they don't have to calculate all their arguments
* Fix it so that cells that are being reported as empty, that excel would give a numeric value of zero, are fixed

## Things that are badly written

* Rewrite the excel_to_ruby command to use command line options
* Refactor excel_to_c_runtime - split the functions? split the tests?
* Tool for turning spreadsheets into tests
* Tool to create minimal failing example out of test run
* The whole thing is slow. Could hold the whole excel AST in memory and apply transforms?
