## Parsing bugs

See doc/How_to_fix_parsing_bugs.md for help

* Whitespace handling in table references
* Whitespace handling between arguments in a list
* Doesn't do range unions (e.g., 10:10 C:C == C:10)
* Doesn't do manually entered arrays {1,2,3;4,5,6}

## Missing functions

See doc/Which_functions_are_implemented.md

See doc/How_to_add_a_missing_function.md

## Simplification & optimisation bugs

* Optimize IF, CHOOSE, MATCH, VLOOKUP and similar functions so that they don't have to calculate all their arguments
* Fix it so that cells that are being reported as empty, that excel would give a numeric value of zero, are fixed
* Fix so that detects when it has finished replacing cells with values, rather than just doing a fixed number of cycles

## Things that are badly written

* Rewrite the excel_to_ruby command to use command line options
* Refactor the common elements of src/commands/excel_to_c.rb and src/commands/excel_to_ruby.rb
* Refactor excel_to_c_runtime - split the functions? split the tests?
* Figure out a common test framework for different code output
* Tool for turning spreadsheets into tests
* Option to reorder test output to make it easier to localise errors
* Tool to create minimal failing example out of test run
