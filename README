This allows some excel spreadsheets to be converted into some other programming languages.

It is a (currently incomplete) rewrite of http://github.com/tamc/rubyfromexcel

# Running excel2code

Doesn't work yet, but the story so far is delivered by running:

    ./bin/excel_to_ruby <excelfile.xlsx> <outputdirectory> <name of sheet with inputs> <name of sheet with outputs>

# Testing excel2code

1. Make sure you have ruby 1.9.2 or later installed
2. gem install bundler # May need to use sudo
3. bundle
4. rspec spec/*
