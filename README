# Excel2Code

This allows some excel spreadsheets to be converted into some other programming languages (currently ruby or c).

Its cannonical source is at http://github.com/tamc/excel2code

# Running excel2code

To just have a go:

	./bin/excel_to_c <excel_file_name>
	
NB:For small spreadsheets this will take a minute or so. For large spreadsheets it is best to run it overnight.
	
for more detail:
	
	./bin/excel_to_c --compile --run-tests --settable <name of input worksheet> --prune-except <name of output worksheet> <excel file name> 

# Testing excel2code

1. Make sure you have ruby 1.9.2 or later installed
2. gem install bundler # May need to use sudo
3. bundle
4. rspec spec/*

# Hacking excel2code

There are some how to guides in the doc folder. 

# Limitations

1. Not tested at all on Windows
2. INDIRECT formula must be convertable at runtime into a standard formula
3. Doesn't implement all functions (see doc/Which_functions_are_implemented.md)
4. Doesn't implement references that involve range unions and lists
5. Sometimes gives cells as being empty, when excel would give the cell as having a numeric value of zero
