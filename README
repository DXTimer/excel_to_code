This allows some excel spreadsheets to be converted into some other programming languages.

It is a (currently incomplete) rewrite of http://github.com/tamc/rubyfromexcel

# Running excel2code

Doesn't work yet, but the story so far is delivered by running:

    ./bin/excel_to_ruby <excelfile.xlsx> <outputdirectory> <name of sheet with inputs> <name of sheet with outputs>

# Testing excel2code

1. Make sure you have ruby 1.9.2 or later installed
2. gem install bundler # May need to use sudo
3. bundle
4. rspec spec/*

# Limitations

1. INDIRECT formula must be convertable at runtime into a standard formula 

# Known bugs

1. Doesn't implement all functions
2. Doesn't implement references that involve range unions and lists
3. Sometimes gives cells as being empty, when excel would give the cell as having a numeric value of zero
