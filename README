This allows some excel spreadsheets to be converted into some other programming languages (currently ruby or c).

It is a rewrite of http://github.com/tamc/rubyfromexcel

# Running excel2code

To just have a go:

	./bin/excel_to_c <excel_file_name>
	
for more detail:
	
	./bin/excel_to_c --compile --run-tests --settable <name of input worksheet> --prune-except <name of output worksheet> <excel file name> 

# Testing excel2code

1. Make sure you have ruby 1.9.2 or later installed
2. gem install bundler # May need to use sudo
3. bundle
4. rspec spec/*

# Limitations

1. Not tested at all on Windows
2. INDIRECT formula must be convertable at runtime into a standard formula
3. Doesn't implement all functions (see below for list)
4. Doesn't implement references that involve range unions and lists
5. Sometimes gives cells as being empty, when excel would give the cell as having a numeric value of zero
